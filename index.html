                                    understanding how browsers work and function between users and servers, and in general how to work with browsers as a developer.</p>

                                <p>I tried to get acquainted with the tools for web developers in different browsers. In addition to Hyper Island jobs and projects, I also used various resources such as Programminghub software, You Tube tutorials, W3C, MDN,
                                    W3School, and YouTube for my self-study.</p>

                                <h5>3. By what criteria have I reached the course goal?</h5>
                                <p>Trying to use web development tools such as code editors and tools inside browsers helped me a lot to be able to reach the goals of the course more easily along with teamwork and projects.</p>

                                <h5>4. What evidence will I show to demonstrate that I have met the course goal?</h5>
                                <p>Certainly the best proof of projects and teamwork in Hyper Island is that it has both design and coding in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And next to them are personal exercises outside the school curriculum that all the code
                                    files and their designs are available and I can provide them if needed.</p>

                                <h5>1. How do I interpret this course goal?</h5>
                                <p>We must always keep in mind that the website development process does not start with coding and does not end after the day we design and launch the website. The preparation phase affects all subsequent steps and defines
                                    how useful the development process will be. Deep discovery of aspects such as the age, gender and interests of our end user may be the key to success. The post-launch period is very significant. Our project should be
                                    agile and flexible enough to change our website according to user feedback or the mood of the time. Remember that nothing, as a trivial step in creating a website, prevents us from unexpected problems and assures us
                                    that everything is going as it should and that we have complete control over the project.</p>

                                <h5>2. How have I engaged with the course goal to learn it?</h5>
                                <p>I think the best way to learn is to practice, and I tried to practice with classmates, use programming training apps, attend Hyper Island lectures, work in design environments like Figma and Photoshop, and talk to developers
                                    in social media and applying their advice by reading various articles on the Internet, increase my knowledge in the field of the web development process. Talking to my project teammates also helped me better understand
                                    the web development process.</p>

                                <h5>3. By what criteria have I reached the course goal?</h5>
                                <p>My criteria for achieving this goal of the course was to better understand the web development process through practice, projects and teamwork so that I could better understand the stages of web development from idea generation
                                    to coding. Given this, I can say that I am very close to this course goal and I know how to start a website and how to get it done.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h5>4. What evidence will I show to demonstrate that I have met the course goal?</h5>
                                <p>There is a lot of evidence, such as the Miro, Figma, and GitHub files, in which I and my teammates started conceptualizing and designing, and then coding the final website by coding the designs, and deliver the website
                                    to the class or client. These are signs of my practice and the work of my classmates in the field of the web development process, which I can share to show the development process.</p>

                                <p>Learn programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and their role in a website, their features, and functions and understand how they communicate, connect and collaborate to display a website as well as knowledge

                                <p>I reviewed online resources and exercises such as <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="blank">Codecademy</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" style="text-decoration: underline;"
                                        target="blank">W3School</a> as much as possible to get good results and progress in learning knowledge in specific development environments, programming languages, instructions, and web language terms (HTML5, CSS3,

                                <p>At the beginning of the course, I did my best to increase my knowledge and knowledge in the field of features and conditions of using programming languages with criteria such as using different resources in relation to
                                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages and doing a site coding project. To be able to enhance my experience in the process of designing and creating a website</p>

                                <p>I can refer to the previous answers again and add that doing projects in teams such as Virtual Travel website, Settr website and designing and building a personal portfolio related to design as well as writing different

                                    journey on the website, typography, contrast, color, typography, and responsiveness and try not to surprise the user, but it is good when designing and building a website try to be innovative as well.</p>
